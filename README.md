# Udacity Frogger, by Dave Mumford

This is the 3rd project in Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum. The purpose of this
project is to showcase student's Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas skills and, of course, to
create a game that is both playable, bug free and fun!

You may play 'Udacity Frogger' online at [http://www.ironwoodlife.com/frogger](http://www.ironwoodlife.com/frogger/).
To view the source code select either the 'Clone in Desktop' or 'Download ZIP' options above.

### Game Objective
The object of the game is to get as many points as possible! The challenge is to focus on the high point
value events during the game (see Scoring below).

### Constraints
Each game lasts only two minutes and the player has only four lives. When the game time has elapsed
**or** the player has used all four lives, then the game is over.

### Player Movement
Move the player using the arrow keys: up, down, left, and right.

### Help
The Game Rules and Hints and much of the information below is available in-game. The rules are displayed
when the game is started for the first time and when ever the 'Game Info' link is selected.

> There are multiple pages of information that can be cycled through using the left and right arrow keys.

### Player Change
Selecting the Ctrl key while hitting the up or down arrow changes the active player. This can be done
at any point in the game, even when it's paused, so you can learn the order of the players! Very important!

### Defeating Enemies
When the player is hit my an enemy bug, the player is killed and sent back to home position on the board.
**But** not always. Each player has a special *Super Power* over one enemy type. Your job is to figure
out which player defeats which enemy.

> Hint: Each player has a coloring scheme that may help you figure out which enemy it can defeat.

> Changing the player on the fly to defeat enemies is the key to this game. Using your player order
knowledge and quick fingers to change the player on the fly, you'll be able to rack up loads of points!

### Point Opportunities
Points are awarded for the following:
Event | Points
 --- | ---
 Each full second in play (not in the grass area) | 1000
 Cleaning up after the ladybugs |  5000
 Defeating a Green Enemy | 2000
 Defeating a Blue Enemy | 4000
 Defeating a Yellow Enemy | 6000
 Defeating a Purple Enemy | 8000
 Defeating a Red Enemy | 10000

Enjoy the game and Good Luck!
